CommandKit was created to make Discord.js more beginner friendly by eliminating the need for boilerplate code and making it easier to handle commands and events. It also provides a few other features that make it easier to develop and maintain your Discord.js applications.

If you're planning to create a large scale Discord bot, CommandKit may work for you, but it's probably not the best choice. For large scale applications I encourage you to either build on top of this library or use something else entirely. This library is mainly aimed to be used in small-medium sized projects.
